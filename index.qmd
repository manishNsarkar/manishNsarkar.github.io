# Bio

I am Manish, a second year PhD student in Dr. Karen Abbott's lab at Case Western Reserve University. I completed my undergraduate and master's degree in Mathematics but I was more interested in applying my analytical skills to understand ecological questions. Currently, I am working on mathematical models to understand the woodland-grassland transitions in African savannas. I'm also interested in group formation, social dynamics among organisms. Epidemiology, public health related questions entice me as well.
